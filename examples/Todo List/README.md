# React VVM Preview

## Todo List

In this sandbox you can add new Todo's, filter them, chose one of them and delete or make as done
the chosen one.

Here you can see an example of using views and child views.

There are 2 view models. One for `App`, so it becomes a store for the whole application, and one
a component, so it becomes a store for this component only.

This example is using the next versions of the libraries:

* `react` - 17
* `react-dom` - 17
* `mobx` - 6
* `mobx-react` - 7
